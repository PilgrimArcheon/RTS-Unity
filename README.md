# RTS-Unity
Real-Time Strategy game that allows players to build and manage their own base, gather resources, and command an army to battle against their opponents. The game is designed with intuitive controls and realistic 3D graphics that create an immersive gaming experience.

Players start the game with a small base and limited resources, but as they gather more resources, they can expand their base, build structures, and create units to build up their army. Players must also manage their resources carefully, balancing the need for resource gathering with the need for building structures and creating units.

The game includes a variety of different unit types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Players must strategically choose which units to create and how to use them in battle to defeat their opponents. The game also features different game modes, including a campaign mode, skirmish mode, and multiplayer mode.

In campaign mode, players progress through a series of missions, each with their own objectives and challenges. In skirmish mode, players can battle against the computer or friends in a one-on-one match. In multiplayer mode, players can connect with other players from around the world and battle against each other in real-time.

The game features responsive controls that allow players to quickly and easily issue commands to their units. The game also includes a fog of war feature, which means that players can only see parts of the map that they have explored, adding an element of surprise and strategy to the gameplay.

As players progress through the game, they can unlock new structures, units, and upgrades, adding to the replay value of the game. The game also includes leaderboards, allowing players to compete against each other for high scores and bragging rights.
